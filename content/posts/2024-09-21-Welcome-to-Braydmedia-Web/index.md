Welcome to Braydmedia Web!

This website is my personal blog. I will use it to write about my thoughts, share photos, write announcements about Braydmedia Services like [Braydmedia Glitch](https://glitch.braydmedia.de), write about topics that interest me and so on.

Even though I am German and speak some other languages, I will use English for my blog, so that most people can understand what I am writing about. You can also find the code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/br4yd/braydmedia-web), where you could even suggest edits in case you find a spelling mistake or something like that!

## About me
Online I go by the alias Brayd. I work in IT and in my free time I usually do sports like Shaolin Kung Fu, weight lifting, running and so on. I also enjoy photography even though I sadly don't have a professional camera. So all photos I share here are shot with my phone.  

I am also vegan and a buddhist, so you can expect posts about these topics, too. :eyes::seedling:
